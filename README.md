# Default_Defense-Credit_Risk_Model
An ML Based model used for finding probability of default of customers before giving Credit.
This project implements a credit risk model using the gradient boosting algorithm. The model was trained on a dataset of historical credit data, and it achieved an accuracy of over 94 percent on a held-out test set.

The model can be used to predict the probability of a customer defaulting on a loan. This information can be used by banks and other lenders to make more informed decisions about whether to grant loans and at what interest rate.
